It may be that some of the below branches have local changes on various laptops.
Would ask students if they know of any changes



Branch information:
Autonomous
- delete, no changes in

Music
- for the music player ability, just because I want our climb to include Star Wars music while hanging there.
- updates to vendordeps with updated driver version
- copy over the sound files
- disable the music by default


ShooterSubsystemSparkMax
- based off of ShooterSubsystem, don't try merging with master at all
- Only has changes in Limelight, not sure which is correct, ask Riley or other students
- some changes were made in both sides of the branch, but will likely be substantially revised after JH plays with system more
- Limelight mostly seems outdated, as compared with changers in ShooterSubsystem
- Likely to delete

master
- consider if we should rename this in FalconRecharged2021.  Computer Science terminology has lots of terminology that harkens back to the bad days
- words like master, slave, blacklist, whitelist are too loaded for today, and should be changed ( e.g. leader / follower )

- useful Constants - consider renaming to DaphneOneConstants for now
- Copy RobotContainer to DaphneOneContainer
- SwerveDriveModule, SwerveDriveSubsystem: preserve daphne 1 / 2 constants, add if to pick one or other

- Discard command changes like AutoDiagonal, and others

- various of Autonomous changes likely not worth recovering, can be rediscovered what is different for Different bots

-  commands to save? AutoDumpAndPickup, all control panel commands (then delete some that don't seem useful)

ShooterSubsystem
- Prefer code from ShooterSubsystem in general
